    "text":"I am 35 years old and have been living in Germany for almost 10 years. My previous professional path led me to research food for children, medical food, and dietary supplements in a laboratory. After almost 10 years in this field, I made the decision to change my career direction.\nInspired by the encouragement of my husband, who is a programmer, I decided to try my hand at this field as well. I started completely from scratch, learning HTML, CSS, and Angular. I wanted to combine this acquired knowledge with another passion of mine, which is cooking (and eating). As a result, I created my own recipe website. For me, this is not just a new career path but also a way to share my love for cooking with others around the world."
