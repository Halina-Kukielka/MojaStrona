    "welcomeText": "Welcome to my website.\n\nI reside in the Taunus region, and I am proficient in Polish, English, and German. Additionally, I hold dual citizenship in Poland and Germany.\n\nTo start, I'd like to discuss my educational background. I completed my high school education with a focus on mathematics and an extended English curriculum. Among my preferred subjects were mathematics, computer science, and the acquisition of foreign languages.\n\nFollowing my high school graduation, I embarked on engineering studies, which I successfully completed. Subsequently, I pursued a master's degree in food technology and human nutrition.\n\nPost-graduation, I commenced employment at the laboratory of a distinguished food research company.\n\nDuring my leisure time, I enjoy cooking and engaging in cycling activities within the Taunus and Rhaingau regions.\n\nAnother passion I have cultivated is programming. Over the course of several years, alongside my professional commitments, I have been actively involved in developing applications using Angular and Java Spring Boot."
