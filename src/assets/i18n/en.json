    "text":"I'm 36 years old and have been living in Germany for over 10 years. My previous professional path led me to research food for children, medical food, and dietary supplements in a laboratory. After 10 years in this field, I made the decision to change my career direction.\n\nInspired by the encouragement of my husband, who is a programmer, I decided to try my hand in this field as well. I started completely from scratch, learning HTML, CSS, and Angular. I wanted to combine this new knowledge with another passion of mineâ€”cooking (and eating). As a result, I have created my own recipe platform - misercook.com. For me, this is not just a new career path but also a way to share my love of cooking with others around the world."
